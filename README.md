## Installation

The application requires 'inquirer' and 'util' node packages.
Run 'npm install inquirer' and 'npm install util' before executing 'node index.js'

## Usage

This Node.js application can be used by developers who would like to save time by generating a professional README baseline that complies with the most used guidelines on creating .md files. A command line prompt guides the user thru a series of questions which auto populate the README.md file once all the questions of the prompt are answered.

- This is an example of prompts when the application is started:
  ![Answered Questions](/assets/images/answeredquestions.PNG "Answered Questions")

- Once all questions are completed an alert is displayed.
  ![Alert](/assets/images/answeredquestions.PNG "Alert")

- This is an example of the written file once the program is completed.
  ![Completed File](/assets/images/readmefile.PNG "Completed File")
