## Description
command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer package.

## Usage Information
This Node.js application can be used by developers who would like to save time by generating a professional README baseline that complies with the most used guidelines on creating .md files. A command line prompt guides the user thru a series of questions which auto populate the README.md file once all the questions of the prompt are answered.

- This is an example of prompts when the application is started:
  ![Answered Questions](/assets/images/beforethealert.PNG "Answered Questions")

- Once all questions are completed an alert is displayed.
  ![Alert](/assets/images/newquestionsanswered.PNG "Alert")

- This is an example of the written file once the program is completed.
  ![Completed File](/assets/images/sample.PNG "Completed File")
